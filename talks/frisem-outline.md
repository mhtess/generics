# Introduction

1. Generics are ubiquitous
2. Hard to identify
3. Convey rich meanings

# Formalizing a prevalence account

1. What is threshold semantics?
2. Problems for prevalence.
3. A rebuttal.
4. RSA.
	1. Ambiguity in scope?
	2. Given-new.
	3. Bare plural: X has Y.
5. Simulations of truth conditions.
	1. Birds lay eggs
	2. Birds are female
	3. Mosquitos
	4. Barns are red?
	5. Birds perform at circuses?

# Dangerous & Distinctive, Nondistinctive, Plain

Truth conditions change. Implications do not.

1. Truth conditions and implications
	A. Bayesian data analysis of a bayesian cognitive model
		A. Truth conditions
		B. Implications
		C. Why do you get this behavior?
	B. Predictions about the prior

### Prior experiments

A. What is the question you would ask?
B. We would love Binned Histograms, but this confuses the heck out of people.
C. What to ask?
	D. Single response
	E. Multiple response
		F. Talk about the sum to 100 behavior
		G. Removing these subjects, do the distributions look the same?
		H. Multistage elicatation
I. Next steps...
J. This is going to be important when we ask finer grained questions. (Danger vs. Distinct)


### Model predictions with empirical priors

1.  Do these empirical priors produce the effects? We see that yes.
2. 	Some ambiguity whether or not measuring the priors is off
3. 	Or whether or not there's something else going on
4. 	So this model predicts the differences in truth conditions (and implications) depending on the prior. Well, CBG tried this also: accidental properties.
