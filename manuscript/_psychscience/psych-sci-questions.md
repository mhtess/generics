### Questions for psych science (50 word max)

1. What is it that the reader will learn from this article that she or he did not (or could not) have known before?

The ability to successfully communicate a generalization about a category relies upon the shared beliefs of interlocutors. The words themselves in a generic sentence like “Dogs bark” do not tell a listener how many dogs have the capacity to bark. Instead, this inference depends upon a listener’s a priori beliefs about the property in question as well as the fact that the sentence is a speech-act, and thus carries communicative force.

2. Why is that knowledge important for psychology?

Understanding the world requires making generalizations about categories. Generic language is used to convey these generalizations: “Dogs bark”, “Rats carry diseases”, and “Politicians make promises”. These simple sentences are understood by 2 year-olds, yet for the first time, there is a formal explanation for what makes these sentences true and how these sentences get interpreted. (56 words)

3. How are the claims made in the article justified by the methods used?

We use a mathematical model based on general principles of language understanding to make predictions about which generalizations about categories are acceptable to communicate and which are unacceptable. We use the same model to make predictions about how novel generic sentences are interpreted. We find that the model explains between 90 - 98% of the variance in human judgments across these tasks.
