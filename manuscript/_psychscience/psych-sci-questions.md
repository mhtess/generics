### Questions for psych science (50 word max)

1. What is it that the reader will learn from this article that she or he did not (or could not) have known before?

Usage of generic language can be explained by the pragmatics of communication. Our formal model uses a simple underlying meaning in terms of the property prevalence, adjusting this meaning in context based on shared background knowledge. This yields the subtle and often surprising phenomena associated with both common and novel generics.

2. Why is that knowledge important for psychology?

Understanding the world requires making generalizations about categories. Generic language is used to convey these generalizations: "Dogs bark", "Rats carry diseases", and "Politicians make promises". These simple sentences are understood by 2 year-olds, yet we provide the first quantitative formal explanation for what makes these sentences true and how these sentences are interpreted. (53 words)

3. How are the claims made in the article justified by the methods used?

We use a Bayesian model based on general principles of language understanding to predict endorsement rates for a variety of commonplace generic sentences and interpretation of novel generic sentences. We empirically measure the priors needed by the model, and then perform model-based Bayesian data analysis.
The model explains more than 90% of the variance in human judgments across these tasks. (51 words)
