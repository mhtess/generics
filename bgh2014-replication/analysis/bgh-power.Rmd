This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# eta2 for adults = 0.22
# 2 groups, for the 2 tasks
eta2 <- 0.22
pwr.anova.test(k=2, n = 16, f = eta2/(1-eta2), sig.level=0.009)
eta2 <- 0.60
pwr.anova.test(k=4, n = 34, f = eta2/(1-eta2), sig.level=0.001)

f<-0.28
eta<- f / (1+f)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
