workerid,debrief
0,I thought important was what helped tell them appart. 
1,Things like color were not important.  Unique characteristics outside of color is what I focused on.  These were usually lethal characteristics.
2,"The extent to which a scientist working in the field should have this information, or if it told something particularly significant about the animal. So dangerous traits of the animals physiology were very important. Distinct features that appeared more than cosmetic, e.g. one animal&quotechars SENSITIVE spots versus the existence of spots in general, were important. Percentages also influenced this to some extent, but not that much."
3,by how dangerous the animal is
4,Whether or not it is necessary or crucial to know. 
5,based on whether the animals were dangerous to humans
6,If it&quotechars important to know or useful to know
7,what researchers and others would need to know to identify animals and research them safely.  
8,I interpreted importance largely with lethality in mind...other uncommon traits may be important (or may not be) depending on their context.
9,By how deadly it was to you.
10,If it affected the observer at all or if it was a key defining factor
11,"how definitive a trait was in identifying a species, as well as how dangerous the trait was."
12,i interpreted importance by the affect the animals&quotechar characteristics would have on their environment and on people. 
13,I did not mean to but the fact of danger made me quick to rate it as important. 
14,Whether something was interesting or dangerous.
15,Whether or not the feature was dangerous or could kill someone
16,"How useful this information was to researchers who might be studying the animal, both in labs and in the field, and the potential impacts of these animals during their interactions with humans (such as potential harm.)"
17,by the read amount and based on the information
18,in form of danger 
19,pragmatically and in terms of usefulness for generalization
20,whether or not the animal was dangerous and some of them just cuz they would be useful for identification from a distance.
21,I considered whether or not the detail was a hazard to my or the animal&quotechars health.
22,Something that is important will affect the lives of humans. The color of things isn&quotechart affecting us. But some of the more dangerous animals that can cause harm to people are important and should be something people know.
23,whether it was dangerous
24,I interpreted it as containing information which can be deadly to a person.
25,"Initially, I was thinking of &quotecharimportance&quotechar in from a curiosity / scientific standpoint. What are certain animals eating that gives them these distinctive colors? Or, why did they evolve that way. Then, as more dangerous characteristics were mentioned, I began to focus on public awareness and safety as &quotecharimportant.&quotechar I then lowered the relative &quotecharimportance&quotechar of curious features. I didn&quotechart really have the context to evaluate the animals until the dangerous ones were mentioned."
26,by the distinct information that was given
27,depended on the value of the information
28,"I rated facts about the animals&quotechar deadliness a higher rating. I also considered facts about rarer traits, such as those which only 30% or fewer of a species had, to be more interesting and therefore higher rating."
29,Information that would be important i identifying and animal and if it could kill you
