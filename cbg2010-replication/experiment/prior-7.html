    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>In this study, we will ask you about some animals that live on a remote island. This island is very large and has many different animals on it. Please try to answer the questions to the best of your ability.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Recently, a team of scientists discovered a remote island with many animals that we did not know existed. Satellite imagery tells us that this island is very large and has many different animals on it. </p>
    <p>In this experiment, you are the resident zoologist of the team and are expected to provide your expert opinion on many questions about these animals. Since the island is so recently discovered, nobody knows the answers to these questions (yet!), but your expert knowledge makes you the most trustworthy source on these matters.</p>
    <button onclick="_s.button()">Continue</button>
  </div>


  <div class="slide" id="practice_prevalence">
    <div class="subj_info_title">Instructional round</div>

    <div>On each trial, you will be a told about a property of an animal on the very large island. 
      For example, you might be told: <strong>"On this very large island, there are animals that lay eggs."</strong>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div> You will then be told: "There are over 1000 different kinds of animals on the island". <br>
      You will be asked two questions.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div> The first question will read something like: <strong>"How many <em>different kinds</em> of animals do you think lay eggs?"</strong>.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div> Here, you might answer anywhere between 10-200 different kinds of animals (rough estimate), depending on how many <strong><em>kinds or species</em></strong> of animals on this island you think lay eggs. 
      (For example, how many different kinds of birds do you think there are?) 
      Just for practice, enter a number between 10-200 here:
    <input type="text" id="prac_response0" maxlength="4" size="4"></input> 
      <button id='button1' onclick="_s.continue()">Continue</button>
  </div>
     <br>
     <div id="part2">
     <div>The second question will read: <strong>"For a particular kind of animal that lays eggs, <em>what percentage of that kind</em> of animal lays eggs?"</strong></div>
    <br>

     <div>Here, you should respond with the percentage of the species that has the property. In our example, you might say something like 35%, because you believe that only adult, female birds lay eggs (at least for the particular species that you have in mind). Put a number between 30-50 into the blank below.</div>
      <input type="text" id="prac_response1" maxlength="3" size="3"></input>% 
      <br>
      <div>You will be asked about different kinds of properties. Please pay attention to the details and respond according your intuition. Ready to go?</div>
