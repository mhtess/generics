 % questions from Judith that MH wants help on
 %% paragraph1: "... we will see the context and the effort in producing this statement." [technically, we don't consider cost; however, also technically, the speaker models have an alternative set of generic + "mu".] so can we talk about the effort? [i've removed it but we can add it back in]
 %% start of paragraph3 : "why do these effects pose a puzzle for formal semantics"? in response to our "Both context and asymmetry effects pose a puzzle for formal semantics."

 % - try rationality parameter in tfbt model
 % - look at "order effect" in prior elicitation (taboo sampling hypothesis... first sample is 0, second is 100, third - fifth are meh)
 % - try an S2 model of prevalence judgement task, too. does it reduce to the L1 model?
