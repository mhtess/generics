# Predictive experiments

## Pilot 1

5/23/2016, n = 20, $0.30 + 40% turk fee = $8.40

Based on Gelman & Bloom (2007) [original n = 16]

+ Origins: Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic
+ Event outcome: Property maintained vs. lost

DV: Agree / Disagree with generic

### Properties

Color, body parts

## Pilot 2 (Predictive elicitation)

5/24/2016, n = 30, $0.30 + 40% turk fee = $12.60

Same as Pilot 2 except for DV

DV (between-subjects): 

+ Predictive likelihood: “If you were to encounter another doble, how likely is it that it would have claws?”  [very unlikely] --- [] --- [very likely]
+ Predictive frequency: “There are 100 other dobles on the planet. How many of them do you think have claws?” [0] — [] — [100]
