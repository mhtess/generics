# Asymmetry experiments

# Prior elicitations
===			

## Prior 1

Table format.

## Prior 2

A pilot test of the 2-stage prior elicitation. 12 trials / participant

## Prior 3

An exploration of dangerous and distinctness. Decided to not be the focus of the first paper, but I think the priors looked like they should should the dangerous vs. control.

## ***Prior 4*

Production ready version of Pilot 2. 30 trials / participant

n = 40 ($1.00)
 						
# Asymmetry experiments

## Asymmetry 1

n = 100; using stims from Cimpian et al. (2010)

## ***Asymmetry 2*

new stimulus set, included 2x accidental properties

+ n = 40 ($0.60)	for implied prevalence
+ n = 40 ($0.60) for truth conditions
